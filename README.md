# LeanPHP Sample for Deploy Now

This is a basic LeanPHP Web Application Sample for Deploy Now
including tailwaind css, built with composer and node. You can use it as a starting point for your project or to give [Deploy Now](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now) a try.

## How to deploy it

1. [Sign in or sign up](https://ionos.space/sign-up) for Deploy Now
2. Click this button and name your new repo

   [![Deploy to IONOS](https://images.ionos.space/deploy-now-icons/deploy-to-ionos-btn.svg)](https://ionos.space/setup?repo=https://github.com/vedyweb/leanphp)

3. Deploy Now will detect necessary build dependencies and commands. You can adjust them and add environment variables.
4. Specify a runtime PHP version, template your config file, define runtime secrets and set up a database or send mail account if required.
5. List paths that you want to keep persistent during deployments and define remote commands you want to execute before and after deployments.

Afterwards, Deploy Now will set up a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow that will be triggered by every new code commit. Build results are automatically deployed to IONOS infrastructure. Projects go live under a preview URL, but you can replace it with a custom domain anytime.
